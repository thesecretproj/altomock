# Alto Mock app

This is the mock app for the first part of my application process. I implemented it using React Native. Tested on Galaxy S6 and iPhone 6S (symmetry); should work fine on other screens. You can run it by following these steps (You will need node.js/npm installed if you don't have it already):

1. navigate to the root of the project in terminal
2. if you don't have expo, install it: 'npm install -g expo-cli'
3. 'npm install'
4. 'expo start'. This will make a QR code pop up in your browser.
5. Download the expo client on an iPhone or Android device from the App store/Play store
6. Scan the QR code in the Expo app (Android) or in the Camera app (iOS).
7. The app is running!
